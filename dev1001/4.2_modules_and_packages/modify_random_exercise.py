MODIFY Exercise: Working with the random module

Tasks:
1. Import the `random` module.
2. Create a list of at least 5 different colors (e.g., "red", "blue", "green").
3. Use `random.choice()` to pick one random color from your list and print it.
4. Simulate rolling a 20-sided die (D20). Generate a random integer between 1 and 20 and print it.
5. Create a list of three friend's names. Use `random.sample()` to pick 2 unique names from the list
   without replacement and print the selection. (Hint: random.sample(population, k))

# Expected output (will vary due to randomness):
# My colors: ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'purple'] (or similar)
# Randomly chosen color: blue (or any from the list)
# D20 roll: 17 (or any number between 1 and 20)
# Sampled friends: ['Alice', 'Charlie'] (or any two unique names from the list)
