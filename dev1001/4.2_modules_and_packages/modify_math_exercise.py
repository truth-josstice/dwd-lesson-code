MODIFY Exercise: Working with the math module

Tasks:
1. Import the `math` module.
2. Calculate and print the circumference of a circle with a radius of 7.
   The formula for circumference is C = 2 * pi * r.
3. Use the `math.ceil()` function to round the number 4.3 up to the nearest integer and print it.
4. Use the `math.floor()` function to round the number 4.8 down to the nearest integer and print it.
5. Calculate 10 to the power of 4 using a function from the math module and print the result.
